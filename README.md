# NotMicrosoft.Configuration

Extending the configuration posibilities of .NET core apps (e.g. making it usable for real production apps and not just for toy apps :)) by applying configurable parameters stored in ini/properties files to json template files. Fully compatible with the built-in json configuration provider - designed to work as a drop-in replacement for it.

See sample for basic usage. I will add later more details and rants :).
